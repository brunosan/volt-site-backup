<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">1. Where to start: Design and build your website</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">NationBuilder comes with a variety of pre-built responsive themes (using these does not require any HTML knowhow). When you first open them they don’t look like the beautiful demo sites that we display in our public theme gallery. Your website is launched with a generic theme (look) and few “placeholder” pages that are ready for you to edit, these include an about page, events page, contact page, join page, and volunteer page.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">To start, decide what you’d like your website to look like. Click on <b>Website &gt; Website name</b> and click on <b>Theme</b>, then <b>Switch to a stock theme</b>. Here you will find the pre-built designs that are readily available for you. Once you find one you like, hover over it and click <b>Use Theme</b>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111285245/b4f9b4e0d55495fa50fdc5a2/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_1_34_06_PM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">Now, within the theme you’ve chosen, you can choose a style. Click on <b>Theme &gt; Switch style</b>. Once you find a style you like, hover over it and click <b>Use style</b>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111285738/706d1ef5739176a70994c018/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_1_35_59_PM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">Awesome, now you’ve selected your site’s overall look. Next, we recommend starting to edit the content on your site. A good place to start is by editing your ‘About’ page.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>NationBuilder’s mascot, Sally the giraffe, is very passionate about keeping her kind protected from being poached by illegal wildlife traders so she recently started a nonprofit called Save the Giraffes! She’d like to build a solid community of supporters to take action and fundraise, so we set Sally up with a nation, and she’s working to set herself up for success. She’s designed her website by picking her theme and style, as well as added some of her own images, so now it’s time to get into the meat of the site by customizing her content. She wants her mission to come across clearly in a variety of ways on her website.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>First, she edits her ‘About’ page to introduce her organization to the world and to make sure others know who they are and what their mission is.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">To edit your ‘About’ page, navigate to <b>Website &gt; Pages</b>, and click on the <b>Edit</b> button to the left of the page name. You’ll find we’ve provided you with some guidance text to get you started. You can also take a look at a great real life example from <a href="http://www.movela.org/about_us" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Move LA</a>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111290552/c6628e81f4f9ca7e451f018c/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_1_59_08_PM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/125754321/880460eb4ae3a38daff5d667/Screen_Shot_2019-06-04_at_3_00_02_PM.png"></div><h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">A few things to keep in mind when customizing your website:</h4>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Content matters more than design</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Our placeholder sites have pictures of Martin Luther King rallies and Sequoia National Park, but not of you. You’d be surprised what good pictures of yourself and community, along with a clear communication of your vision, can do to your site. Make sure the images are of high quality and resolution. <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/how-pages-work/include-files-and-images-on-a-page">Here’s how to add images to a page on your site</a>.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">For an example of great content, check out <a href="https://www.joinonelove.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Love</a>. </p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Featured content sliders and background images</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Once you have solid pictures and have added them to pages, it’s time to make the site really pop. Featured content sliders are a scrolling bar of images that link to other parts of your site on your homepage. They provide a huge visual upgrade without the hassle of coding. You may have noticed them on the demos on NationBuilder’s site. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Featured content sliders can be easily swapped out to reflect the current needs of your organization. Need more people to read the blog? Create a featured content slider that redirects folks to the newest piece of news. Featured content sliders live at <b>Website &gt; Pages &gt; Edit page &gt; Settings &gt; Featured content sliders</b>. <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/how-pages-work/configure-featured-content-sliders">You can find the best dimensions for featured content sliders on your particular public theme here</a>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/125754348/696aea20c691cabc0ffafada/Screen_Shot_2019-06-04_at_3_01_09_PM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111292050/95c3e28679b13f11dba7f07f/Screen+Shot+2019-03-26+at+2.07.31+PM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">Background images, if done properly, can also dramatically improve the look and feel of your site. Make sure the image itself isn’t too distracting and fits nicely behind your content. When you’ve found the right large, high quality image (<a href="https://unsplash.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> is a great resource for this!), go to the <b>Website</b> tab in the control panel, click on <b>Site settings</b> and then <b>Background image</b>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111292127/221ce4176326055222e64ea9/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_10_57_06_AM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-left"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111292225/6abe7c19c7c39c334d1f27b6/Screen+Shot+2019-03-26+at+2.08.32+PM.png"></div><h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Homepage excerpts</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">You’ve got a big fundraiser next week and you need more people to buy tickets. You can make any page, like your events calendar, appear on your home page to showcase the latest event. This is another cool visual upgrade that only requires you to tag a page. NationBuilder automatically creates a plug in for the page and displays it on your home page. This can be set by navigating to <b>Website &gt; Pages &gt; Edit page &gt; Settings &gt; Page settings &gt; Tags</b>.  <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/configure-your-website/nationbuilder-stock-theme-guidelines">Learn more about how to do this here</a>.</p>

<p class="intercom-align-left">A splash page recognizes a new visitor to your site and displays a unique welcome page that can encourage them to sign up to support your organization, donate, or RSVP for an event. Like the homepage excerpts, <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/types-of-pages/set-up-a-splash-page">any action page can be turned into a splash page</a> under <b>Settings &gt; Page settings</b>. </p>

<p class="intercom-align-left">If there’s one visual change you can’t live without, consider hiring a NationBuilder architect to make small changes to your site. These folks are certified and understand the product. <a href="http://www.nationbuilder.com/architects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check out a list of architects here</a>. </p>

<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">2. Call people to action: Gain volunteers, donations, petition signatures and set up events</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Use the site to collect membership information, host events, keep people up-to-date, and enable members to have their own log-ins to certain content areas. <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/how-pages-work/create-and-edit-webpages">NationBuilder websites</a> equip you with the ability to create <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/types-of-pages/types-of-nationbuilder-pages">30 different action pages</a>. Your call to action can be one central call to action (e.g. “Sign the petition”) or a ladder of engagement that clearly directs visitors from easy to harder steps. You can increase the likelihood that step one leads to step two by creating <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website#how-pages-work">action chains</a>, <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/website/how-pages-work/sharing-your-site-on-social-media">social share prompts</a>, and autoresponse emails. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Before she started Save the Giraffes, Sally was circulating a petition, and she’s decided she's going to set up an additional page on her site for this. She creates a petition page to house the petition online, which will allow other giraffes to sign it online and allow her to keep track of all of the signers in her nation’s database.</i></p>

<p class="intercom-align-left">Give each member of your team <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/settings/your-account/manage-control-panel-users">access</a> to your nation. When logged in to the control panel, team members will be able to view, in real time, all the actions your supporters are taking, track conversations, and tag supporters with relevant information. We typically refer to these folks as control panel users (CPU’s) in NationBuilder.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally has a team of four volunteers that are on board to help with outreach and events. She sets up this core team with control panel access, that way they can view supporters/prospects, track conversations, and more.</i></p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111294566/c84be5d4af1f758150476bfd/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_2_21_12_PM_1.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/152583319/0f5cb0906ff49b1f470636e9/Screen+Shot+2019-10-01+at+9.48.28+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://youtu.be/EH-HpkIWLT4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Watch a video</b></a><b> </b>about managing control panel users. </p>
<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">4. Get ready to accept donations: Connect your bank account</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Define your organization's goals and connect your payment processor to begin accepting donations from your supporters. Leaders need to be able to raise money--to support their work, grow their memberships, take donations, and sell tickets to their events. Integrated into the platform, and included standard for every NationBuilder customer, is the ability for you to accept payments right in NationBuilder. No more need for a third-party payment processor with monthly fees, complicated set up, or a separate donations system that doesn’t sync with the data in your nation.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally also knows it’s important to be ready to accept donations, so she’s set up integrated payment processing with NationBuilder to make it super-efficient to collect contributions, as well as for her supporters to contribute.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/finances/basics/accept-payments-with-nationbuilder">Set up your account</a> so that your donation page can go live:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <b>Settings &gt; Payment processors &gt; Set up a new account</b>.</li>
<li>Complete the required fields and follow the instructions. Hit the <b>Save</b> button when you are done.</li>
</ul>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If you are not in the US or Canada, NationBuilder offers integrations with a variety of <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/finances/configuring-third-party-payment-processors/connecting-a-third-party-payment-processor">third-party payment processors</a>.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/117096756/876f00e9c3619c9b3d470ac4/Screen_Shot_2019-04-24_at_9_59_35_AM.png"></div><h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">5. Build your foundation: Import data</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Your organization probably engaged with people before you started your nation. You can load membership data, email lists, financial data and more into NationBuilder’s control panel!</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Save the Giraffes has a small network already thanks to some previous email lists, which Sally imports into her nation. She will use this data as a basis for outreach/social targeting, so she can begin to grow her community.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://youtu.be/XmguaaZHcyE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Watch a video</b></a><b> </b>that guides you though an import. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Here are a few things to note about data:</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Email lists</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Email addresses are the basic building block of most NationBuilder databases, as they help uniquely-identify your prospects and supporters, serving as anchors for practically every online engagement with your organization.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Time and again, email has been shown to have the highest return on investment — <a href="http://www.emailmonday.com/dma-national-client-email-report-2015" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upwards of 3800%</a> — of any online communications channel. And the more sources of data you layer onto your email list, the more sophisticated your own targeting and personalization can be:</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/148772084/a3877317431023d05b3f3626/Screen+Shot+2019-09-16+at+8.10.36+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">You can also <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/set-up-your-broadcaster/connect-an-email-address-to-a-broadcaster">sync your work email</a> with a personal broadcaster. Doing so will automatically log 1:1 emails on the recipient's profile in NationBuilder, ensuring that if another teammate reaches out, they’ll have valuable context on where that relationship stands.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111444609/528c395b4fee3bec5eee6467/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_12_50_42_PM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Possible other sources of email data:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Own an email list of people from a previous digital outreach campaign that might be interested in your new endeavor? Reach out to those prospects. (If they don't bite, simply batch opt them out).</li>
<li>Migrating off Constant Contact or MailChimp? <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/tectonicatools_app" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tectonica’s free import tools</a> can quickly sync those to your nation.</li>
<li>Migrating off another 3rd party tool? Email lists are <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/data/how-to-import">simple to import</a> yourself, or you can <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/free_import_services#included" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">send them our way so we can handle it for you</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Offline engagement data</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Odds are your team engages supporters offline as well as on. They have calls and one-on-ones with volunteers or possible donors. They organize events where attendees are asked to sign-in. Or maybe they're out collecting signatures on physical petitions.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Whatever offline engagement looks like for you, if that data isn’t in your nation, you run the risk of alienating your top activists. Have you volunteered for a cause you care about, only to later receive a blast from them with no recognition of that contribution? How did that make you feel?</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If some of that data is spread across Google Sheets somewhere — don't worry, if you have people’s email addresses in those records, with a little clean-up, you can easily add that vital offline data to supporters’ existing profiles in your nation.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Here are 3 examples:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Spreadsheet of event attendees + their contact info: Export that as a CSV file, upload it to NationBuilder, enter “event-your event-attendee” into a “tag everyone with” field. Everyone imported will get that tag.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet of volunteers with columns for each possible volunteer role, and “X/YES” values in cells beneath the roles a volunteer is suited for: Find and replace “X” with “volunteer-xyz role” in each column, then map each of those columns to “tag_list.” Cell values will be appended as a tag.</li>
<li>Ever organize an event through Eventbrite? Use <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/eventbrite_connect" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eventbrite Connect</a> to import up to 4 events and 200 people for free ($25/month to auto-sync all new events).</li>
</ul>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111444760/e94066dc142a1c1fa45bb5f4/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.16.16+AM.png"></div><h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Financial data</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">As you know, you can raise money online through NationBuilder. Most organizations will <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/import_donations" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">import any past online donations</a> when they first get started on NationBuilder. (If you did not, let us know ASAP.)</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Having all your contribution data in NationBuilder empowers you to deliver personalized asks at scale by tailoring the appeal based on recipients' giving history. Why ask these folks to chip in just $8, when you could ask them to match their average gift?</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111445270/bc0293670c8bab32ec70e41b/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.18.01+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">Treat fundraising like a conversation, and your donors will feel seen and appreciated — rather than like your organization's ATM.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Here are 3 sources of financial data you may be missing:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Checks received from major donors— don’t accidentally send someone who just contributed $5,000 a generic fundraising email. </li>
<li>If you’re tracking major donors in another system, import those donations; moving forward, <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/finances/basics/create-a-new-donation-in-the-control-panel">enter those contributions</a> one-by-one as they come in.</li>
<li>Are you using a 3rd party tool to sell merch?— You may be interested in <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/shopifyconnect" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify Connect</a> ($25/mo), which can automatically import contacts and their purchase data (with tracking codes) from Shopify. You can also use <a href="https://nationbuilder.com/adding_ecwid_shopping_cart_nationbuilder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ecwid’s shopping cart software</a> whose plans range from free to upwards of $15 per month.</li>
</ul>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Using your data</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Once your network is in your nation, it’s time to put your data to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of donations and export donor history to file expense reports. Navigate to<b> Finances &gt; Export &gt; Export Donations</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Collect social media interactions in real time to see what issues people are most passionate about. You can even <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/send-communications/tag-people-who-liked-a-facebook-post">tag people who have liked certain Facebook page posts</a>

<p class="intercom-align-left">An organization's mission should be broken down into measurable goals. These goals can be tracked within a nation. Goals provide a snapshot of an organization's success and areas needing improvement. When entering the control panel, current goals are displayed on the Dashboard, providing an overview of the nation's health.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally has decided that Save the Giraffe’s first goal is to gain 1,000 new supporters in the first three months. She sets up this goal in her nation and her entire team can view progress on the dashboard when they log in.  </i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">To set a goal, from your <b>Dashboard</b> click <b>New goal </b>(or click <b>Set a goal</b> under one of the pre-set goal types).</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111454241/0a459e44167b23bf889f40a4/Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7_46_21_AM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111454465/0f0483fba19006232d675469/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.43.40+AM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111454606/c237caf5fb073d352ecb0f59/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.47.55+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://youtu.be/bt-FiqdEJ84" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Watch a video</b></a><b> </b>about goal creation. </p>
<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">7. Prepare for outreach: Connect your email address/socials</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Communication between your organization and your community is consolidated around <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/set-up-your-broadcaster/understanding-broadcasters">broadcasters</a>. When you attach an email address to a broadcaster, you can send email blasts to your community. By taking a few extra steps in setting up your broadcaster, you can also accept incoming email for a broadcaster. This will allow recipients to reply to your bulk email. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Now Sally is eager to connect with her supporters. She’s read some of NationBuilder's HowTo's and knows she would benefit greatly by setting up a broadcaster for email correspondence. She also links her social media accounts so she can post on Facebook or Twitter and track post engagement/tag giraffes who interact with her accounts.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/set-up-your-broadcaster/connect-an-email-address-to-a-broadcaster">Connect your broadcasters</a> to email addresses to prepare for one-on-one and <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/send-communications/create-an-email-blast">blast email</a> communication by going to <b>Communication &gt; + New Broadcaster.</b></p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111454733/97d91b41f4685c9d5eee88b4/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_1_04_39_PM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">Also, connect your organization’s <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/set-up-your-broadcaster/connect-your-facebook-account-to-a-broadcaster">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/set-up-your-broadcaster/connect-your-twitter-account-to-a-broadcaster">Twitter</a> accounts to your nation. Go to <b>Communication &gt; Click on the broadcaster &gt; Connect Facebook page/Twitter account</b>. The NationBuilder people database will now record each time people in your database interact with your official social media accounts. This provides you with a wealth of engagement data that’ll become valuable as you move into more targeted outreach. If you’re serious about growing in a targeted manner, <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/data/how-to-use-recurring-twitter-imports">create recurring Twitter imports</a>; you’ll be able to find and convert the top followers of any Twitter handle into supporters.  </p>

<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">8. Make outreach easy: Use NationBuilder to help automate workflows for your team</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">When someone takes the time to sign up to volunteer or donate to your organization, you want to make sure that person gets the attention they deserve. The last thing you want is an email asking for money to go to a donor who just donated hundreds to your organization. Keeping track of your relationships is important and the best way to do that is by <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/gather-profiles/tracking-relationships">managing your workflow</a> in NationBuilder. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Ideally, when a volunteer signs up or a person decides to donate, a few of things will happen: </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">1. They will get <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/gather-profiles/how-to-use-tags">auto tagged</a>. This gives them a label for easy sorting later.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally would like to keep track of all the giraffes who sign her petition, this way she can find them and reach out to them later to solicit further support. She sets up her petition page to tag all signers with ‘protection-petition’.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">You’ll find the ability to set auto tags by navigating to <b>Website &gt; Website name &gt; Edit (next to page you wish to add auto tags to) &gt; [Page type] Settings</b> <b>&gt; Advanced.</b></p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/152594106/24ec8258c5085da32efeb045/Screen_Shot_2019-10-01_at_10_21_36_AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">2. They will be added to a <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/basics/create-a-path">path</a>. A path is a step-by-step workflow that describes how people taking action contribute toward achieving the larger goal. As a person completes various steps, they are moved along the path to its completion. This deliberate distribution of work provides clarity on how individual support helps achieve the organization's mission. Paths are the cornerstone to building internal alignment and accountability.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally also wants to add petition signers to a path, that way she can use this simple workflow to move these giraffes toward supporting the organization as a whole by donating or volunteering. Sally decides to edit the default path ‘Become a volunteer’ to include the steps she plans to take to make giraffes volunteers.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">To create/edit paths, go to <b>People &gt;</b> click the <b>Path button &gt; + Create path</b> OR click the <b>Edit</b> button next to a path.</p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/152594671/1d2bb8fc15d779378d1c2c13/Screen_Shot_2019-10-01_at_10_24_32_AM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111455366/8fcff78cf53777f058136cab/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.50.35+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left">3. They will be assigned to a <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/gather-profiles/tracking-relationships">point person</a>. This person is responsible for ensuring the volunteer/donor follows up on their promise. </p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Next, Sally is going to assign a point person to the petition page who will be in charge of outreach involving the giraffes who end up on this path.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">To assign a point person go to<b> Website &gt; Website name &gt; Edit (next to page you wish to add a point person to) &gt; [Page type] Settings</b> <b>&gt; Basics.</b></p>
<div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111455526/ac9658c8f06a642f1449de65/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_1_15_33_PM.png"></div><div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/111456122/ba308f8406278c22a5cc5b57/Screen+Shot+2019-03-27+at+7.52.53+AM.png"></div><p class="intercom-align-left"><a href="https://youtu.be/fc_gEqAWLlc" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>Watch a video</b></a><b> </b>that covers setting up automation for tags, paths, point people, etc.</p>
<h2 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">9. Build your community: Target people and localize engagements</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If you’re ready to rise above the fray, tailor your digital outreach to meet prospective supporters where they’re at, whether it’s Millennials, mothers, or Minnesotans. This is where you can really utilize the ability to <a href="https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_filter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use filters</a> and <a href="https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_create_a_list" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lists</a> to get specific with your outreach.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Also, remember people are telling you all kinds of information on social media. If you decide not to listen you will lose donations, votes, and supporters.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><i>Sally has now posted her first Facebook post (since connecting it to her nation). She decided to post an article with statistics about giraffe poachers and captures. She tagged all giraffes who liked the post with ‘giraffe-protection-fbk’. Now she has identified their interest and knows these giraffes are currently engaged with something that is the cornerstone of her mission. Next, she may tailor an email blast about her organization’s mission specifically for these giraffes.</i></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Here are five ways to listen on social media:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn social into local. <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/target-people/how-to-target-people">Find</a> everyone who follows you, lives in a particular neighborhood, and has a specific keyword in their Twitter bio.</li>
<li>Anticipate what people need to hear. Find <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/people/data/how-to-use-recurring-twitter-imports">everyone on Twitter</a> who follows similar organizations. Buy Twitter advertising that targets this list with information about the endorsement.</li>
<li>Make Facebook work for you. Pull up a list of <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/send-communications/tag-people-who-liked-a-facebook-post">everyone who “liked” your gun control post on Facebook</a>. Bonus: you might have email addresses for some of these folks, so this information could turn into a targeted email blast to this constituency.</li>
<li>Identify interest and excitement. Organize your database based on who has liked your Facebook post, commented on your Facebook page, RSVP’d to an event, retweeted you, mentioned you, or followed you on Twitter in the past week. These folks are interested in you right now. Alternate: run the same search but find anyone who has done any three of these activities in the past week. These folks are excited about you right now. Act accordingly.</li>
<li>Build on expressions of support. Find everyone who is subscribed to your email list, has volunteered for an event, or who has engaged with your website who doesn’t yet follow you on Twitter. Ask them to fix that problem, and provide them two or three things to tweet right now (extra points if you have their cell phone number and can <a href="https://support.nationbuilder.com/communication/send-communications/send-and-receive-text-messages">send them an SMS message</a> with these tweetable nuggets). Watch the trending topics shift in your direction.</li>
